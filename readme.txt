Hello Mr. Smith,

I have created this extra file to briefly explain to you about some factors and details of my website.

First, I have worked on my website as if it would actually be published on the internet for everyone to visit and see.
Therefore, I have an extra page called "About" where I explain about my website and citing information.
On the About page, I have a small function coded in JavaScript that shows a date and time if clicked on.

Second, you may have noticed this on my last year project, I have a copyright tag as a footer note on every page to make my website look as much professional as possible.

Lastly, I have added a small function coded in Javascript that you can turn on/off a bulb.
The goal of adding the light bulb simulation is to help the readers understand easier about the concept of Binary Code System where there are only two possible values like turning on/off a light bulb only has two options.
Also, I have added a JavaScript function that hides the contents in the section of Examples of Application.
I added it because I thought it would be more interesting and some people might not want to see the examples.

I hope you enjoy looking around my website.


Sincerely,

Ivy
