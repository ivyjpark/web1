					Many of the technologies we use everyday consume a lot of resources and powers. Pollution caused by producing and using technology can cause some serious problems regarding the pollution of air and water and producing heat and noise. Also, non-renewable resources like metal gold are getting used up to make technologies and even some renewable resources like water and trees are becoming contaminated or are used up faster than they can renew themselves. Clearing lands and building factories to produce technologies could cause some serious issues as well such as contaminating the food chain and pollution of nature. To solve these problems, technology users should use their tech as much as they need and turn them off when not in use. We can use the new technologies to protect the environment by using lights that can sense when no one is in the room and automatically turns off. We can also reduce the amount of trees cut down by using paperless communication like email and online bill paying.
