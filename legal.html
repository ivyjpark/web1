					In the internet world, there are many open chances of crime since no one can actually see anyone. One of the crimes is piracy. Using someone else's work without permission is a crime. Copyright is protection of digital information. Copyright infringement is the illegal use or reproduction of data. The law, NET (No Electronic Theft Act) protects against copyright infringement. Copyright infringement includes duplication of a file or a program when copies are being used by an individual who has not paid for it or has not got any permission.<br><br>Another issue that is legally considered is virus. Malicious code is produced by those who illegally get others' informations and sell them to make profit for themselves. Virus comes in many forms and is delivered in many ways. They can appear through executable programs, emails, and Internet connections which are believed to be easily opened. One of the devastating effects of malicious code is the destruction of data. Therefore, users should be careful when opening a link or a program that does not have an evident sender.
